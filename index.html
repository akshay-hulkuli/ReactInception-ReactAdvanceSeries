        We could have injected simple header into html using javascript with this code
        <script>
            const header = document.createElement("h1");
            header.innerHTML = "Hello World from the javascript"
            console.log(header); // prints html element
            const root = document.getElementById("root");
            root.appendChild(header);
        </script> 
    -->


    <!-- Now let us see how we can create and inject header using react -->

    <!-- 
        This file contains the code responsible for dom manipulation from react.
        This is needed for browsers where we need to play with dom. (Incase of react native we migth have a different file)

    <!-- 
        It is not recommended to use CDN script calls to get react, as it is a costly operation including network call.
        We can easily store required react scripts in the node modules by installing it using npm.
        And also version management is challenging if we use CDN.
